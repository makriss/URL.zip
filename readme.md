# URL.zip

URL.zip is an open source url shortening website, that minifies long verbose urls into tiny memorable urls in no time. All you need to do is paste the url you want to minify and voila! it zips it into a tiny url.

In addition to url shortening feature, there's an analytics tab for the users. User can view two related metrics - 
1. Number of times a url has been minified
2. Number of times a minified url has been clicked

Website by default uses **url.zip** domain. For instance https://twitter.com/kunalkamra88 is minified to url.zip/hmps14r.
But the domain name can be easily customised by changing DOMAIN_URL attribute in constants.py
